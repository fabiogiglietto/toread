Through systematic weekly searches over six months using eleven queries, we identify major limitations regarding completeness, representativeness, consistency, and bias. Our findings reveal substantial differences between ranking parameters like relevance and date in terms of video recall and precision, with relevance often retrieving numerous off-topic videos. We also find severe temporal decay, as the number of findable videos for a specific period dramatically decreases after just 20-60 days from the publication date, potentially hampering many different research designs. Furthermore, search results lack consistency, with identical queries yielding different video sets over time, compromising replicability. A case study on the European Parliament elections highlights how these issues impact research outcomes. While the paper offers several mitigation strategies, it concludes that the API&#x27;s search function, potentially prioritizing ``freshness&#x27;&#x27; over comprehensive retrieval, is not adequate for robust academic research, especially concerning Digital Services Act requirements.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Rieder, Bernhard, Padilla, Adrian, Coromina, Oscar</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> arXiv [cs.IR]</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2025</li></ul>",

This is a key measurement problem in sociological inquiry, from the study of how interest groups shape media discourse, to the spread of policy across institutions, to the diffusion of organizational structures and institution themselves. To study how ideas and narratives diffuse across text, we must first develop a method to identify whether texts share the same information and narratives, rather than the same broad themes or exact features. We propose a novel approach to measure this quantity of interest, which we call “narrative similarity,” by using large language models to distill texts to their core ideas and then compare the similarity of\n            &lt;jats:italic&gt;claims&lt;/jats:italic&gt;\n            rather than of words, phrases, or sentences. The result is an estimand much closer to narrative similarity than what is possible with past relevant alternatives, including exact text reuse, which returns lexically similar documents; topic modeling, which returns topically similar documents; or an array of alternative approaches. We devise an approach to providing out-of-sample measures of performance (precision, recall, F1) and show that our approach outperforms relevant alternatives by a large margin. We apply our approach to an important case study: The spread of Russian claims about the development of a Ukrainian bioweapons program in U.S. mainstream and fringe news websites. While we focus on news in this application, our approach can be applied more broadly to the study of propaganda, misinformation, diffusion of policy and cultural objects, among other topics.\n          &lt;/jats:p&gt;</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Hannah Waight, Solomon Messing, Anton Shirikov, Margaret E.

Analyzing a dataset of 793K TikTok videos related to the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, we uncover a range of coordinated activities, from synchronized amplification of political narratives to semi-automated content replication using AI-generated voiceovers and split-screen video formats. Our findings show that while traditional coordination indicators generalize well to TikTok, other signals, such as those based on textual similarity of video transcripts or Duet and Stitch interactions, prove ineffective, highlighting the platform&#x27;s distinct content norms and interaction mechanics.

Many existing methods for detecting this coordination, though, have relied primarily on post-timing, which is trivially easy to change. In this paper, we make a significant methodological advancement in coordination detection, leveraging highly regular statistical patterns in the speed and frequency of sharing. We apply and validate this approach on Facebook, using 11.2 million link posts from a list of 16,169 most popular English-language Facebook pages that referenced at least one of the top eight US politicians in any post, a set of pages that produced more than 91\\% of all user engagement in this category during our collection period. Our approach can be calibrated and adapted across contexts, platforms, and times, allowing researchers to build valid, testable, but still human-interpretable models of platform manipulations.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunkang Yang, Ramesh Paudel, Jordan McShan, Matthew Hindman, H.

In particular, the methodological framework we outline here has the potential to incorporate multiple distinct modes of interaction into a single practice map; can be further enriched with account-level attributes such as information gleaned from textual analysis, profile information, available demographic details, and other features; and can be applied even to a cross-platform analysis of communicative patterns and practices. The article presents practice mapping as an analytical framework and outlines its key methodological considerations. Given its prominence in past social media research, we draw on examples and data from the platform formerly known as Twitter to enable experienced scholars to translate their approaches to a practice mapping paradigm more easily, but point out how data from other platforms may be used in equivalent ways in practice mapping studies. We illustrate the utility of the approach by applying it to a dataset where the application of conventional network analysis and visualization approaches has produced few meaningful insights.\n          &lt;/jats:p&gt;</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Axel Bruns, Kateryna Kasianenko, Vish Padinjaredath Suresh, Ehsan Dehghan, Laura Vodden</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> Social Media + Society</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2025</li><li><strong>Volume:</strong> 11</li><li><strong>Pages:</strong> 20563051251331748</li><li><strong>Citations:</strong> 0</li><li><strong>References:</strong> 50</li></ul><h3>Links</h3><p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051251331748\">DOI</a></p>",

This theoretical article draws on the concept of connective democracy, further theorizing it to bridge the gap between empirical online deliberation and polarization research. It introduces and refines the concept of destructive polarization and its symptoms—manifested in user-generated content on social media platforms—and applies connective democracy theory to examine these symptoms’ underlying causes. The framework shifts from the dominant focus on the quality of individual communication acts to a focus on the quality of connections, particularly within dyadic communication. Through this relational perspective, the article explores how reciprocity and listening can serve as remedies to destructive polarization, fostering high-quality connections between citizens online. Reciprocity and listening are discussed as communicative mechanisms that should be nurtured as part of depolarization strategies. Finally, the article offers insights into what platform providers and community managers can learn from this theoretical exercise to promote democratic discourse online.&lt;/jats:p&gt;</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Katharina Esau</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> Social Media + Society</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2025</li><li><strong>Volume:</strong> 11</li><li><strong>Pages:</strong> 20563051251332421</li><li><strong>Citations:</strong> 0</li><li><strong>References:</strong> 88</li></ul><h3>Links</h3><p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051251332421\">DOI</a></p>",

It provides a taxonomy of conceptualizations and operationalizations, analyzing how measurement approaches and contextual factors influence outcomes. The review of 129 studies identifies variations in measurement approaches, as well as regional, political, cultural, and platform-specific biases, as key factors contributing to the lack of consensus. Studies based on homophily and computational social science methods often support the echo chamber hypothesis, while research on content exposure and broader media environments, such as surveys, tends to challenge it. Group behavior, cultural influences, instant messaging platforms, and short video platforms remain underexplored. The strong geographic focus on the United States further highlights the need for studies in multi-party systems and regions beyond the Global North. Future research should prioritize cross-platform studies, continuous algorithmic audits, and investigations into the causal links between polarization, fragmentation, and echo chambers to advance the field. This review also provides recommendations for using the EU’s Digital Services Act to enhance research in this area and conduct studies outside the US in multi-party systems. By addressing these gaps, this review contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of echo chambers, their measurement, and their societal impacts.&lt;/jats:p&gt;</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> David Hartmann, Sonja Mei Wang, Lena Pohlmann, Bettina Berendt</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> Journal of Computational Social Science</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2025</li><li><strong>Volume:</strong> 8</li><li><strong>Pages:</strong> 52</li><li><strong>Citations:</strong> 0</li><li><strong>References:</strong> 188</li></ul><h3>Links</h3><p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s42001-025-00381-z\">DOI</a></p>",

We use an innovative technique to identify time-bounded Twitter/X following events, and then use difference-in-differences to show that attention brokers cause triad transitivity by amplifying content.

It investigates the empirical case of IOs engaged in covert political campaigning in the 2022 Philippine General Elections through qualitative field research. Drawing from 22 in-depth interviews with IO leads and staff, we define IOs’ broker attributes, their brokerage processes, and the capital and value they generate through brokerage. We identify four mechanisms of brokerage by IOs: infrastructural capacity, reputation manipulation, relationship building at scale, and obscured accountability. These mechanisms complement the brokerage work by aboveboard campaigns and other brokers by compensating for their limitations and innovating campaign strategies. We argue that IOs are not extraneous deviations but are logical extensions of existing political infrastructures and should be understood as operating with other normative forms of political campaigning.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Gaw, Fatima, Agonos, Mariam Jayne, Ruijgrok, Kris, Suarez, Gerard Martin</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> Int.

Especially for framing in the news, this leaves out valuable information about editorial choices, which include not just the written article but also accompanying photographs. To overcome such limitations, we present a method for conducting multi-modal, multi-label framing analysis at scale using large (vision-) language models. Grounding our work in framing theory, we extract latent meaning embedded in images used to convey a certain point and contrast that to the text by comparing the respective frames used. We also identify highly partisan framing of topics with issue-specific frame analysis found in prior qualitative work. We demonstrate a method for doing scalable integrative framing analysis of both text and image in news, providing a more complete picture for understanding media bias.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Arnav Arora, Srishti Yadav, Maria Antoniak, Serge Belongie, Isabelle Augenstein</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> arXiv [cs.CL]</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2025</li></ul><h3>Links</h3><p><a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20960v3\">arXiv</a></p>",

We build on this work to estimate the ideology of a political YouTube video.

Second, we train a language model with those estimated ideologies as training labels, enabling us to estimate the ideologies of videos not posted on Reddit. These predicted ideologies are then validated against human labels. We demonstrate the utility of this method by applying it to the watch histories of survey respondents to evaluate the prevalence of echo chambers on YouTube in addition to the association between video ideology and viewer engagement.

Although insightful, the institutionalist literature offers little reflection about the growing role of social technologies in organizing and mobilizing extremist networks in ways that present many challenges to traditional party gatekeeping, institutional integrity, and other democratic principles. We present a more integrated framework that explains how digitally networked publics interact with more traditional party surrogates and electoral processes to bring once-scattered extremist factions into conservative parties. When increasingly reactionary parties gain power, they may push both institutions and communication processes in illiberal directions. We develop a model of communication as networked organization to explain how Donald Trump and the Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement rapidly transformed the Republican Party in the United States, and we point to parallel developments in other nations.&lt;/jats:p&gt;</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> W.

CooRTweet&#x27;s distinctiveness lies in its essential architecture, derived from a minimal definition of coordinated behavior that captures its core elements in an  abstract way. This approach makes it possible for the tool to be applied to the widest range of cases, from mono-modal network analysis on a single social media platform, to multi-modal and cross-platform network analysis, and to any types of objects shared by a network, whether singular identical objects (e.g., the same tweet), similar objects (e.g., clusters of similar images), or complex objects (e.g., a combination of hashtags, images, and emojis). Additionally, it offers a comprehensive view of coordinated activities that include both explicit coordination and organic forms of content sharing. The comprehensive architecture of CooRTweet provides flexibility and a broad scope for analyzing coordinated activities across various digital landscapes. This positions it as a distinctive resource for researchers investigating coordinated communication online. More generally, CooRTweet provides a valuable example to methodologists and research tool developers of how software tools for research can be developed in a  generalized and thus flexible way. This is particularly important for social media research, given how quickly new APIs are being released, modified, and even shut down. This paper aims to provide an introduction to CooRTweet and the analysis of coordinated behavior, demonstrating the software&#x27;s application through a case study of cross-platform coordinated behavior during the 2021 German elections.&lt;/p&gt;</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicola Righetti, Paul Balluff</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2025</li><li><strong>Citations:</strong> 0</li><li><strong>References:</strong> 0</li></ul><h3>Links</h3><p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/zya2x_v1\">DOI</a></p>",

While fact-checking is positioned to provide objective information, fact-checking posts on social media often involve heightened emotionality. How much emotionality is present and how emotionality influences audience engagement and public sentiment toward fact-checked targets remain largely understudied. Informed by social psychological frameworks explicating message-level factors influencing public engagement and sentiment, the present study examines emotionality in 49,270 fact-checking posts created by 10 United States fact-checking organizations on Facebook from 2017 to 2022. Results showed that emotionality in fact-checking posts significantly increased by 13.5% over the years. Editorial fact-checkers (e.g., Washington Post) used higher levels of emotionality than independent fact-checkers (e.g., snopes.com). Emotionality positively indicated public engagement as predicted. However, in both fact-checked true and false information, emotionality was negatively associated with the public’s sentiment toward fact-checked targets, suggesting a potential spillover effect on stories verified to be true. This study reveals that emotionality in fact-checking posts boosts social media engagement yet with the potential of compromising fact-checking effectiveness. &lt;/jats:p&gt;</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Haoning Xue, Jingwen Zhang, Xinzhi Zhang</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> Social Media + Society</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2025</li><li><strong>Volume:</strong> 11</li><li><strong>Pages:</strong> 20563051251318172</li><li><strong>Citations:</strong> 0</li><li><strong>References:</strong> 75</li></ul><h3>Links</h3><p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051251318172\">DOI</a></p>",

A common approach is to assess the trustworthiness of sources rather than individual pieces of content. One of the most widely used and comprehensive databases for source trustworthiness ratings is provided by NewsGuard. Since creating the database in 2019, NewsGuard has continually added new sources and reassessed existing ones. While NewsGuard initially focused only on the US, the database has expanded to include sources from other countries. In addition to trustworthiness ratings, the NewsGuard database contains various contextual assessments of the sources, which are less often used in contemporary research on misinformation. In this work, we provide an analysis of the content of the NewsGuard database, focusing on the temporal stability and completeness of its ratings across countries, as well as the usefulness of information on political orientation and topics for misinformation studies. We find that trustworthiness ratings and source coverage have remained relatively stable since 2022, particularly for the US, France, Italy, Germany, and Canada, with US-based sources consistently scoring lower than those from other countries. Additional information on the political orientation and topics covered by sources is comprehensive and provides valuable assets for characterizing sources beyond trustworthiness. By evaluating the database over time and across countries, we identify potential pitfalls that compromise the validity of using NewsGuard as a tool for quantifying untrustworthy information, particularly if dichotomous &quot;trustworthy&quot;/&quot;untrustworthy&quot; labels are used. Lastly, we provide recommendations for digital media research on how to avoid these pitfalls and discuss appropriate use cases for the NewsGuard database and source-level approaches in general.&lt;/jats:p&gt;</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Jula Lühring, Hannah Metzler, Ruggero Lazzaroni, Apeksha Shetty, Jana Lasser</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> Journal of Quantitative Description: Digital Media</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2025</li><li><strong>Volume:</strong> 5</li><li><strong>Citations:</strong> 1</li><li><strong>References:</strong> 0</li></ul><h3>Links</h3><p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.51685/jqd.2025.003\">DOI</a></p>",

For nearly a decade, the Meta Newsroom has been a major outlet for Meta company announcements, and since 2016, the Newsroom has increasingly become a key source for company responses to concerns regarding mis/disinformation and other kinds of problematic content on Meta’s platforms. Using a mixed-methods approach informed by discourse analysis, this article critically examines Newsrooms posts from 2016 to early 2021. It asks: how is Meta framing ‘problems’ on its platforms? How is Meta identifying ‘solutions’ to those problems? And is Meta ‘nudging’ policymakers in specific conceptual directions? Overall, we find that Meta is framing content moderation issues through four key frames – ‘authenticity’, ‘political advertising’, ‘technological solutions’, and ‘enforcement’ – that benefit Meta, as they shift responsibility while also demonstrating that Meta is an active and capable problem-solver. &lt;/jats:p&gt;</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Edward Hurcombe, Ehsan Dehghan, Laura Vodden, Daniel Angus</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> Convergence: The International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2025</li><li><strong>Pages:</strong> 13548565251315521</li><li><strong>Citations:</strong> 0</li><li><strong>References:</strong> 81</li></ul><h3>Links</h3><p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/13548565251315521\">DOI</a></p>",

This study analyzes Twitter data from before and after the removal of key Arizona Election Audit Twitter accounts in March of 2021. After collecting tweets that refer to the election audit in Arizona in this designated timeframe, a before/after comparison examines the structure of the networks, the volume of the participating population, and the themes of their discourse. Several significant changes are observed, including a drop in participation from accounts that were not deplatformed and a de-centralization of the Twitter network. Conspiracy theories remain in the discourse, but their themes become more diffuse, and their calls to action more abstract. Recruiting calls to join in on promoting and publicizing the audit mostly come to an end. The decision by Twitter to deplatform key election audit accounts appears to have greatly disrupted the hub structure at the center of the emergent network that formed as a response to the election audit. By intervening in the network, moderators successfully defused much of the Twitter-based participation in the Arizona Election Review of 2021. This instance demonstrates the efficacy of network-driven interventions in platform moderation, specifically for events or accounts that use social media to organize or encourage bad-faith attacks on civic instituions. &lt;/jats:p&gt;</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Simeone, Steven R.

While closed-ended questions ease analysis and data collection, they necessarily limit the depth and variability of responses. Open-ended responses allow for greater depth and variability in responses but are labor-intensive to code. Large Language Models (LLMs) can solve some of these problems, but existing approaches to using LLMs have a number of limitations. In this paper, we propose and test a pairwise comparison method to scale open-ended survey responses on a continuous scale. The approach relies on LLMs to make pairwise comparisons of statements that identify which statement ``wins&#x27;&#x27; and ``loses&#x27;&#x27;. With this information, we employ a Bayesian Bradley-Terry model to recover a `score&#x27; on a the relevant latent dimension for each statement. This approach allows for finer discrimination between items, better measures of uncertainty, reduces anchoring bias, and is more flexible than methods relying on Maximum Likelihood Estimation techniques. We demonstrate the utility of this approach on an open-ended question probing knowledge of interest rates in the US economy. A comparison of 6 LLMs of various sizes reveals that pairwise comparisons show greater consistency than zero-shot 0-10 ratings with larger models (&amp;amp;gt; 9-billion parameters). Further, comparison of pairwise decisions are consistent with high-knowledge crowd source workers.&lt;/p&gt;</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew DiGiuseppe, Michael E Flynn</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> SocArXiv</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2025</li><li><strong>Citations:</strong> 0</li><li><strong>References:</strong> 0</li></ul><h3>Links</h3><p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/39ajg\">DOI</a></p>",

Although such research has investigated the topical and stylistic characteristics of misinformation, its findings are frequently not interpreted systematically in relation to properties that journalists rely on to capture the attention of audiences, that is, in relation to news values. We close the gap on comparative studies of news values in misinformation with a perspective that emphasizes non-WEIRD countries. Relying on a dataset of URLs that were shared on Facebook in twenty-four countries and reported by users as containing false news, we compile a large corpus of online news items and use an array of computational tools to analyze its content with respect to a set of five news values (conflict, negativity, proximity, individualization, and informativeness). We find salient differences for almost all news values and regarding the WEIRD/non-WEIRD and flagged/unflagged distinction. Moreover, the prevalence of individual news values differs strongly for individual countries. However, while almost all differences are significant, the effects we encounter are mostly small. &lt;/jats:p&gt;</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Sami Nenno, Cornelius Puschmann</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> The International Journal of Press/Politics</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2025</li><li><strong>Pages:</strong> 19401612241311893</li><li><strong>Citations:</strong> 1</li><li><strong>References:</strong> 65</li></ul><h3>Links</h3><p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/19401612241311893\">DOI</a></p>",

Yet, little is known of the relationship between party politics and the spread of misinformation—in part due to a dearth of cross-national empirical data needed for comparative study. This article examines which parties are more likely to spread misinformation, by drawing on a comprehensive database of 32M tweets from parliamentarians in 26 countries, spanning 6 years and several election periods. The dataset is combined with external databases such as Parlgov and V-Dem, linking the spread of misinformation to detailed information about political parties and cabinets, thus enabling a comparative politics approach to misinformation. Using multilevel analysis with random country intercepts, we find that radical-right populism is the strongest determinant for the propensity to spread misinformation. Populism, left-wing populism, and right-wing politics are not linked to the spread of misinformation. These results suggest that political misinformation should be understood as part and parcel of the current wave of radical right populism, and its opposition to liberal democratic institution. &lt;/jats:p&gt;</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Petter Törnberg, Juliana Chueri</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> The International Journal of Press/Politics</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2025</li><li><strong>Pages:</strong> 19401612241311886</li><li><strong>Citations:</strong> 5</li><li><strong>References:</strong> 69</li></ul><h3>Links</h3><p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/19401612241311886\">DOI</a></p>",

Using time series analysis techniques including cross-correlation, Granger causality, and anomaly detection, we modeled this data to test for the relationship between significant algorithmic ranking updates to Facebook’s News Feed algorithms and user engagement with Guardian articles on the platform. Our results show that strategic interventions to the News Feed algorithm significantly impacted engagement with hard news items, whereas opinion, lifestyle, sports, and arts content were less affected. This study challenges the notion of algorithms as ‘black boxes’ by demonstrating how Facebook’s deliberate adjustments influence user engagement with news content. We conclude by outlining the limitations and challenges for systemic auditing of social media algorithms, advocating for greater data access, and discussing the opportunities afforded by the EU’s Digital Services Act to advance this research agenda.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Naoise McNally, Marco Bastos</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> Digital Journalism</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2025</li><li><strong>Pages:</strong> 1--20</li><li><strong>Citations:</strong> 1</li><li><strong>References:</strong> 81</li></ul><h3>Links</h3><p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/21670811.2025.2450623\">DOI</a></p>",

Here we identify three common misperceptions: that average exposure to problematic content is high, that algorithms are largely responsible for this exposure and that social media is a primary cause of broader social problems such as polarization. In our review of behavioural science research on online misinformation, we document a pattern of low exposure to false and inflammatory content that is concentrated among a narrow fringe with strong motivations to seek out such information. In response, we recommend holding platforms accountable for facilitating exposure to false and extreme content in the tails of the distribution, where consumption is highest and the risk of real-world harm is greatest. We also call for increased platform transparency, including collaborations with outside researchers, to better evaluate the effects of online misinformation and the most effective responses to it. Taking these steps is especially important outside the USA and Western Europe, where research and data are scant and harms may be more severe.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Ceren Budak, Brendan Nyhan, David M.

During the initial three months after the Russian invasion in February 2022, videos under the hashtag #Ukraine garnered 36.9 billion views, with individual videos scaling up to 88 million views. Beyond the traditional methods of spreading misleading information through images and text, the medium of sound has emerged as a novel, platform-specific audiovisual technique. Our analysis distinguishes various war-related sounds utilized by both Ukraine and Russia and classifies them into a mis- and disinformation typology. We use computational propaganda features—automation, scalability, and anonymity—to explore how TikTok’s auditory practices are exploited to exacerbate information disorders in the context of ongoing war events. These practices include reusing sounds for coordinated campaigns, creating audio meme templates for rapid amplification and distribution, and deleting the original sounds to conceal the orchestrators’ identities. We conclude that TikTok’s recommendation system (the “for you” page) acts as a sound space where exposure is strategically navigated through users’ intervention, enabling semi-automated “soft” propaganda to thrive by leveraging its audio features. &lt;/jats:p&gt;</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Marcus Bösch, Tom Divon</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> New Media &amp;amp; Society</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2024</li><li><strong>Volume:</strong> 26</li><li><strong>Pages:</strong> 5081--5106</li><li><strong>Citations:</strong> 7</li><li><strong>References:</strong> 99</li></ul><h3>Links</h3><p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/14614448241251804\">DOI</a></p>",

Yet most research studies a single platform—typically Twitter/X, or occasionally Facebook—leaving little known about the broader social media landscape. Here we shed new light on patterns of cross-platform variation in the high-stakes context of news sharing. We examine the relationship between user engagement and news domains’ political orientation and quality across seven platforms: Twitter/X, BlueSky, TruthSocial, Gab, GETTR, Mastodon, and LinkedIn. Using an exhaustive sampling strategy, we analyze all (over 10 million) posts containing links to news domains shared on these platforms during January 2024. We find that the news shared on platforms with more conservative user bases is significantly lower quality on average. Turning to patterns of engagement, we find—contrary to hypotheses of a consistent “right wing advantage” on social media—that the relationship between political lean and engagement is strongly heterogeneous across platforms. Conservative new posts receive more engagement on platforms where most content is conservative, and vice versa for liberal news posts,  consistent with an “echo platform” perspective. In contrast, the relationship between news quality and engagement is strikingly consistent: across all platforms examined, lower-quality news posts received higher average engagement even though higher quality news is substantially more prevalent and garners far more total engagement across posts. This pattern holds despite accounting for poster-level variation, and is observed even in the absence of ranking algorithms, suggesting user preferences – not algorithmic – bias may underlie the underperformance of higher-quality news.&lt;/p&gt;</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohsen Mosleh, Jennifer Nancy Lee Allen, David Gertler Rand</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> PsyArXiv</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2024</li><li><strong>Citations:</strong> 0</li><li><strong>References:</strong> 0</li></ul><h3>Links</h3><p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/9csy3\">DOI</a></p>",

Through online observation and textual analysis of TikTok posts and their corresponding comment sections, we demonstrate how online incivility is subtly amplified through humour and play, and how Gen Z and young children became both objects and producers of these dogshows.

We conducted a systematic integrative literature review across social sciences and humanities (n = 169), addressing algorithm literacy in terms of its key conceptualizations and the endogenous, exogenous, and personal factors that influence it. We argue that existing research can be framed in terms of experiential learning cycles and outline how this approach can be beneficial for acquiring algorithm literacy. Finally, we propose a future research agenda that includes defining core competencies relevant to algorithm literacy, standardization of measures, integrating subjective and factual aspects of algorithm literacy, and task- and domain-specific approaches.&lt;/jats:p&gt;</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Emilija Gagrčin, Teresa K.

Influential psychological theories propose that conspiracy beliefs are uniquely resistant to counterevidence because they satisfy important needs and motivations. Here, we raise the possibility that previous attempts to correct conspiracy beliefs have been unsuccessful merely because they failed to deliver counterevidence that was sufficiently compelling and tailored to each believer’s specific conspiracy theory (which vary dramatically from believer to believer). To evaluate this possibility, we leverage recent developments in generative artificial intelligence (AI) to deliver well-argued, person-specific debunks to a total of N = 2,190 conspiracy theory believers. Participants in our experiments provided detailed, open-ended explanations of a conspiracy theory they believed, and then engaged in a 3 round dialogue with a frontier generative AI model (GPT-4 Turbo) which was instructed to reduce each participant’s belief in their conspiracy theory (or discuss a banal topic in a control condition). Across two experiments, we find robust evidence that the debunking conversation with the AI reduced belief in conspiracy theories by roughly 20%. This effect did not decay over 2 months time, was consistently observed across a wide range of different conspiracy theories, and occurred even for participants whose conspiracy beliefs were deeply entrenched and of great importance to their identities. Furthermore, although the dialogues were focused on a single conspiracy theory, the intervention spilled over to reduce beliefs in unrelated conspiracies, indicating a general decrease in conspiratorial worldview, as well as increasing intentions to challenge others who espouse their chosen conspiracy. These findings highlight that even many people who strongly believe in seemingly fact-resistant conspiratorial beliefs can change their minds in the face of sufficient evidence.&lt;/p&gt;</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas H Costello, Gordon Pennycook, David Gertler Rand</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> Science</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2024</li><li><strong>Volume:</strong> 385</li><li><strong>Pages:</strong> eadq1814</li><li><strong>Citations:</strong> 9</li><li><strong>References:</strong> 0</li></ul><h3>Links</h3><p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/xcwdn\">DOI</a></p>",

However, Coordinated inauthentic Behaviour (CIB), defined as orchestrated efforts by entities to deceive or mislead users about their identity and intentions, has emerged as a tactic to exploit the online discourse. In this study, we quantify the efficacy of CIB tactics by defining a general framework for evaluating the influence of a subset of nodes in a directed tree. We design two algorithms that provide optimal and greedy post-hoc placement strategies that lead to maximising the configuration influence. We then consider cascades from information spreading on X (formerly known as Twitter) to compare the observed behaviour with our algorithms. The results show that, according to our model, coordinated accounts are quite inefficient in terms of their network influence, thus suggesting that they may play a less pivotal role than expected. Moreover, the causes of these poor results may be found in two separate aspects: a bad placement strategy and a scarcity of resources.&lt;/jats:p&gt;</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Niccolò Di Marco, Sara Brunetti, Matteo Cinelli, Walter Quattrociocchi</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> ACM Transactions on the Web</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2025</li><li><strong>Volume:</strong> 19</li><li><strong>Pages:</strong> 1--19</li><li><strong>Citations:</strong> 2</li><li><strong>References:</strong> 78</li></ul><h3>Links</h3><p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1145/3700644\">DOI</a></p>",

Due to its private nature and the difficulty of collecting information, little is known about these campaigns and the messages they disseminate. Given this context, our study investigates the presence of coordinated activities on WhatsApp in Brazil, identifying their content and purpose, especially how these messages relate to recent Brazilian political events. To answer these questions, we analyzed 13 million messages from 1,444 political groups over seven months from July 2022 to January 2023. Using network analysis, our findings suggest a significant prevalence of coordinated activity in the propagation of news messages, 26% of which originate from misinformation sites. Furthermore, we found that images play a key role in coordinated activity, accounting for 15% of messages, which are also used to mislead. Finally, coordinated accounts were used to organize collective actions, including attacks and protests against election results.&lt;/jats:p&gt;</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Kansaon, Philipe de Freitas Melo, Savvas Zannettou, Fabricio Benevenuto</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2025</li><li><strong>Volume:</strong> 19</li><li><strong>Pages:</strong> 1007--1020</li><li><strong>Citations:</strong> 0</li><li><strong>References:</strong> 0</li></ul><h3>Links</h3><p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1609/icwsm.v19i1.35857\">DOI</a></p>",

This article examines how participants in primarily U.S.-based Far-Right online communities describe their adoption of “redpill” beliefs and the role of disinformation in these accounts. Applying the socio-technical theory of media effects, we conduct a qualitative content analysis of “redpilling narratives” gathered from Reddit, Gab, and Discord. While many users frame redpilling as a moment of conversion, others portray redpilling as a process, something achieved incrementally through years of community participation and “doing your own research.” In both cases, disinformation presented as evidence and the capacity to determine the veracity of presented evidence play important roles in redpilling oneself and others. By framing their beliefs as the rational and logical results of fully considering a plethora of evidence, redpill adherents can justify holding and promoting otherwise indefensible prejudices. The community’s creation, promotion, and repetition of Far-Right disinformation, much of which is historical or “scientific” in nature, play a crucial role in the adoption of Far-Right beliefs.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Marwick, Alice E, Furl, Katherine</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> Int.
