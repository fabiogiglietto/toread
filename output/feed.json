Traditional methods often rely on monomodal approaches, focusing on single types of interactions like co-retweets or co-hashtags, or consider multiple modalities independently of each other. However, these approaches may overlook the complex dynamics inherent in multimodal coordination. This study compares different ways of operationalizing the detection of multimodal coordinated behavior. It examines the trade-off between weakly and strongly integrated multimodal models, highlighting the balance between capturing broader coordination patterns and identifying tightly coordinated behavior. By comparing monomodal and multimodal approaches, we assess the unique contributions of different data modalities and explore how varying implementations of multimodality impact detection outcomes. Our findings reveal that not all the modalities provide distinct insights, but that with a multimodal approach we can get a more comprehensive understanding of coordination dynamics. This work enhances the ability to detect and analyze coordinated online behavior, offering new perspectives for safeguarding the integrity of digital platforms.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Mannocci, Lorenzo, Cresci, Stefano, Magnani, Matteo, Monreale, Anna, Tesconi, Maurizio</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> arXiv [cs.SI]</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2025</li></ul>",

Nonetheless, its use has been dominated by loose intuitions of what narratives are and do alongside vague accounts of specific stories. Theorized more carefully, thinking in terms of narrative has much to offer disinformation studies by helping to better define what constitutes disinformation and providing sophisticated frameworks for assessing specific content. To enable a nuanced view of narrative truth, I propose a “hermeneutic realist” approach in which stories “disclose” wider realities rather than constructing or simply reflecting them, supplemented with Phelan’s “narrative ethics” to facilitate inquiry into how far stories are morally legitimate. I apply these ideas in a case study of Twitter content posted by a Venezuelan political influencer blaming Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine on NATO enlargement. In so doing, I show that content may be referentially and ethically problematic without necessarily being false.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Sadler, Neil</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> Commun.

While classification of political events has traditionally relied on manual coding or rigid rule-based systems, modern language models offer the potential for more nuanced, context-aware analysis. However, deploying these models requires overcoming significant technical and resource barriers. We demonstrate how to adapt open-source language models to specialized political science tasks, using conflict event classification as our proof of concept. Through quantization and efficient fine-tuning techniques, we show state-of-the-art performance while minimizing computational requirements. Our approach achieves a macro-averaged AUC of 0.791 and a weighted F1-score of 0.753, representing a 37.6\\% improvement over the base model, with accuracy gains of up to 1463\\% in challenging classifications. We offer a roadmap for political scientists to adapt these methods to their own research domains, democratizing access to advanced NLP capabilities across the discipline. This work bridges the gap between cutting-edge AI developments and practical political science research needs, enabling broader adoption of these powerful analytical tools.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Meher, Shreyas, Brandt, Patrick T</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> Res.

Drawing on qualitative content analysis of 202 highly viewed videos, we examine how identity markers such as race and gender shape who is empowered or undermined in conspiratorial narratives, and how creators construct and circulate “evidence” to support their claims. We find that American ConspiracyTok is populated largely by young, non-White, and/or female creators who challenge the stereotype of the White, male conspiracy theorist. These creators interpellate audiences through visible identity markers, fostering a sense of intimacy and trust. Marginalized groups are often cast as victims, while institutions like science, government, and media are portrayed as villains. Creators construct legitimacy through visual media, personal anecdotes, deep lore, and remixing fictional and mainstream texts—engaging in a form of populist knowledge production within a generous epistemology that welcomes divergent truths and alternative worldviews. These practices blur the lines between entertainment and ideology, often mimicking academic, or journalistic knowledge production while rejecting institutional authority. While ConspiracyTok can serve as a form of standpoint epistemology that empowers minoritized creators and critiques systemic injustice, it can just as easily reinforce bias and spread disinformation. ConspiracyTok is a site of vernacular theorizing where epistemology and identity are deeply entangled, offering both a critique of mainstream power and a cautionary tale about the populist appeal of conspiratorial thinking.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Marwick, Alice, Pippert, Courtlyn, Furl, Katherine, Schnabel, Elaine</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> Soc.

However, their ability to do this within political discourse remains largely underexplored. Leveraging, for the first time, the large IMPAQTS corpus, which comprises Italian political speeches with the annotation of manipulative implicit content, we propose methods to test the effectiveness of LLMs in this challenging problem. Through a multiple-choice task and an open-ended generation task, we demonstrate that all tested models struggle to interpret presuppositions and implicatures. We conclude that current LLMs lack the key pragmatic capabilities necessary for accurately interpreting highly implicit language, such as that found in political discourse.

Unlike previous studies, misleadingness here is determined by agreement across a diverse community of platform users, rather than by fact-checkers. We find that 2.3 times more posts by Republicans are flagged as misleading compared to posts by Democrats. These results are not base rate artifacts, as we find no meaningful overrepresentation of Republicans among X users. Our findings provide strong evidence of a partisan asymmetry in misinformation sharing which cannot be attributed to political bias on the part of raters, and indicate that Republicans will be sanctioned more than Democrats even if platforms transition from professional fact-checking to Community Notes.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Renault, Thomas, Mosleh, Mohsen, Rand, David G</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> Proc.

This is a key measurement problem in sociological inquiry, from the study of how interest groups shape media discourse, to the spread of policy across institutions, to the diffusion of organizational structures and institution themselves. To study how ideas and narratives diffuse across text, we must first develop a method to identify whether texts share the same information and narratives, rather than the same broad themes or exact features. We propose a novel approach to measure this quantity of interest, which we call “narrative similarity,” by using large language models to distill texts to their core ideas and then compare the similarity of claims rather than of words, phrases, or sentences. The result is an estimand much closer to narrative similarity than what is possible with past relevant alternatives, including exact text reuse, which returns lexically similar documents; topic modeling, which returns topically similar documents; or an array of alternative approaches. We devise an approach to providing out-of-sample measures of performance (precision, recall, F1) and show that our approach outperforms relevant alternatives by a large margin. We apply our approach to an important case study: The spread of Russian claims about the development of a Ukrainian bioweapons program in U.S. mainstream and fringe news websites. While we focus on news in this application, our approach can be applied more broadly to the study of propaganda, misinformation, diffusion of policy and cultural objects, among other topics.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Waight, Hannah, Messing, Solomon, Shirikov, Anton, Roberts, Margaret E, Nagler, Jonathan, Greenfield, Jason, Brown, Megan A, Aslett, Kevin, Tucker, Joshua A</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> Sociol.

Despite acknowledging the presence of coordinated campaigns and implementing restrictions on the number of messages forwarded per user, the platform continues to be abused. Due to its private nature and the difficulty of collecting information, little is known about these campaigns and the messages they disseminate. Given this context, our study investigates the presence of coordinated activities on WhatsApp in Brazil, identifying their content and purpose, especially how these messages relate to recent Brazilian political events. To answer these questions, we analyzed 13 million messages from 1,444 political groups over seven months from July 2022 to January 2023. Using network analysis, our findings suggest a significant prevalence of coordinated activity in the propagation of news messages, 26\\% of which originate from misinformation sites. Furthermore, we found that images play a key role in coordinated activity, accounting for 15\\% of messages, which are also used to mislead. Finally, coordinated accounts were used to organize collective actions, including attacks and protests against election results.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Kansaon, Daniel, Melo, Philipe de Freitas, Zannettou, Savvas, Benevenuto, Fabricio</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2025</li><li><strong>Volume:</strong> 19</li><li><strong>Pages:</strong> 1007--1020</li></ul>",

Applying the socio-technical theory of media effects, we conduct a qualitative content analysis of “redpilling narratives” gathered from Reddit, Gab, and Discord. While many users frame redpilling as a moment of conversion, others portray redpilling as a process, something achieved incrementally through years of community participation and “doing your own research.” In both cases, disinformation presented as evidence and the capacity to determine the veracity of presented evidence play important roles in redpilling oneself and others. By framing their beliefs as the rational and logical results of fully considering a plethora of evidence, redpill adherents can justify holding and promoting otherwise indefensible prejudices.

Building on existing approaches, we construct user similarity networks based on shared behaviors, including synchronized posting, repeated use of similar captions, multimedia content reuse, and hashtag sequence overlap, and apply graph pruning techniques to identify dense networks of likely coordinated accounts. Analyzing a dataset of 793K TikTok videos related to the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, we uncover a range of coordinated activities, from synchronized amplification of political narratives to semi-automated content replication using AI-generated voiceovers and split-screen video formats. Our findings show that while traditional coordination indicators generalize well to TikTok, other signals, such as those based on textual similarity of video transcripts or Duet and Stitch interactions, prove ineffective, highlighting the platform&#x27;s distinct content norms and interaction mechanics.

The review of 129 studies identifies variations in measurement approaches, as well as regional, political, cultural, and platform-specific biases, as key factors contributing to the lack of consensus. Studies based on homophily and computational social science methods often support the echo chamber hypothesis, while research on content exposure and broader media environments, such as surveys, tends to challenge it. Group behavior, cultural influences, instant messaging platforms, and short video platforms remain underexplored. The strong geographic focus on the United States further highlights the need for studies in multi-party systems and regions beyond the Global North. Future research should prioritize cross-platform studies, continuous algorithmic audits, and investigations into the causal links between polarization, fragmentation, and echo chambers to advance the field. This review also provides recommendations for using the EU’s Digital Services Act to enhance research in this area and conduct studies outside the US in multi-party systems. By addressing these gaps, this review contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of echo chambers, their measurement, and their societal impacts.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Hartmann, David, Wang, Sonja Mei, Pohlmann, Lena, Berendt, Bettina</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> J.

However, Coordinated inauthentic Behaviour (CIB), defined as orchestrated efforts by entities to deceive or mislead users about their identity and intentions, has emerged as a tactic to exploit the online discourse. In this study, we quantify the efficacy of CIB tactics by defining a general framework for evaluating the influence of a subset of nodes in a directed tree. We design two algorithms that provide optimal and greedy post-hoc placement strategies that lead to maximising the configuration influence. We then consider cascades from information spreading on X (formerly known as Twitter) to compare the observed behaviour with our algorithms. The results show that, according to our model, coordinated accounts are quite inefficient in terms of their network influence, thus suggesting that they may play a less pivotal role than expected. Moreover, the causes of these poor results may be found in two separate aspects: a bad placement strategy and a scarcity of resources.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Di Marco, Niccolò, Brunetti, Sara, Cinelli, Matteo, Quattrociocchi, Walter</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> ACM Trans.

The article presents practice mapping as an analytical framework and outlines its key methodological considerations. Given its prominence in past social media research, we draw on examples and data from the platform formerly known as Twitter to enable experienced scholars to translate their approaches to a practice mapping paradigm more easily, but point out how data from other platforms may be used in equivalent ways in practice mapping studies. We illustrate the utility of the approach by applying it to a dataset where the application of conventional network analysis and visualization approaches has produced few meaningful insights.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Bruns, Axel, Kasianenko, Kateryna, Suresh, Vish Padinjaredath, Dehghan, Ehsan, Vodden, Laura</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> Soc.

It introduces and refines the concept of destructive polarization and its symptoms—manifested in user-generated content on social media platforms—and applies connective democracy theory to examine these symptoms’ underlying causes. The framework shifts from the dominant focus on the quality of individual communication acts to a focus on the quality of connections, particularly within dyadic communication. Through this relational perspective, the article explores how reciprocity and listening can serve as remedies to destructive polarization, fostering high-quality connections between citizens online. Reciprocity and listening are discussed as communicative mechanisms that should be nurtured as part of depolarization strategies.

So far, such studies have been narrow, in that they use a fixed set of pre-defined frames and focus only on the text, ignoring the visual contexts in which those texts appear. Especially for framing in the news, this leaves out valuable information about editorial choices, which include not just the written article but also accompanying photographs. To overcome such limitations, we present a method for conducting multi-modal, multi-label framing analysis at scale using large (vision-) language models. Grounding our work in framing theory, we extract latent meaning embedded in images used to convey a certain point and contrast that to the text by comparing the respective frames used. We also identify highly partisan framing of topics with issue-specific frame analysis found in prior qualitative work. We demonstrate a method for doing scalable integrative framing analysis of both text and image in news, providing a more complete picture for understanding media bias.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Arora, Arnav, Yadav, Srishti, Antoniak, Maria, Belongie, Serge, Augenstein, Isabelle</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> arXiv [cs.CL]</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2025</li></ul>",

Previous literature has examined bias across many applications and contexts, but less work has focused specifically on bias in generative LLMs&#x27; responses to subjective annotation tasks. This bias could result in labels applied by LLMs that disproportionately align with majority groups over a more diverse set of viewpoints. In this paper, we evaluate how LLMs represent diverse viewpoints on these contentious tasks. Across four annotation tasks on four datasets, we show that LLMs do not show systematic substantial disagreement with annotators on the basis of demographics. Rather, we find that multiple LLMs tend to be biased in the same directions on the same demographic categories within the same datasets. Moreover, the disagreement between human annotators on the labeling task -- a measure of item difficulty -- is far more predictive of LLM agreement with human annotators. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for researchers and practitioners using LLMs for automated data annotation tasks. Specifically, we emphasize that fairness evaluations must be contextual, model choice alone will not solve potential issues of bias, and item difficulty must be integrated into bias assessments.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Brown, Megan A, Atreja, Shubham, Hemphill, Libby, Wu, Patrick Y</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> arXiv [cs.CL]</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2025</li></ul>",

Most scholars point to the role of parties, leaders, and institutional changes, along with the pursuit of voters through what Daniel Ziblatt has characterized as alliances with more extremist party surrogate organizations. Although insightful, the institutionalist literature offers little reflection about the growing role of social technologies in organizing and mobilizing extremist networks in ways that present many challenges to traditional party gatekeeping, institutional integrity, and other democratic principles. We present a more integrated framework that explains how digitally networked publics interact with more traditional party surrogates and electoral processes to bring once-scattered extremist factions into conservative parties. When increasingly reactionary parties gain power, they may push both institutions and communication processes in illiberal directions. We develop a model of communication as networked organization to explain how Donald Trump and the Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement rapidly transformed the Republican Party in the United States, and we point to parallel developments in other nations.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Bennett, W Lance, Livingston, Steven</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> Perspect.

Drawing from 22 in-depth interviews with IO leads and staff, we define IOs’ broker attributes, their brokerage processes, and the capital and value they generate through brokerage. We identify four mechanisms of brokerage by IOs: infrastructural capacity, reputation manipulation, relationship building at scale, and obscured accountability. These mechanisms complement the brokerage work by aboveboard campaigns and other brokers by compensating for their limitations and innovating campaign strategies. We argue that IOs are not extraneous deviations but are logical extensions of existing political infrastructures and should be understood as operating with other normative forms of political campaigning.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Gaw, Fatima, Agonos, Mariam Jayne, Ruijgrok, Kris, Suarez, Gerard Martin</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> Int.

Using time series analysis techniques including cross-correlation, Granger causality, and anomaly detection, we modeled this data to test for the relationship between significant algorithmic ranking updates to Facebook’s News Feed algorithms and user engagement with Guardian articles on the platform. Our results show that strategic interventions to the News Feed algorithm significantly impacted engagement with hard news items, whereas opinion, lifestyle, sports, and arts content were less affected. This study challenges the notion of algorithms as ‘black boxes’ by demonstrating how Facebook’s deliberate adjustments influence user engagement with news content. We conclude by outlining the limitations and challenges for systemic auditing of social media algorithms, advocating for greater data access, and discussing the opportunities afforded by the EU’s Digital Services Act to advance this research agenda.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> McNally, Naoise, Bastos, Marco</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> Digit.

The research extends the understanding of how frames—emerging, complex, and often subtle concepts—become prominent in online conversations that are polarized. The study proposes a comprehensive methodology for identifying and characterizing these frames, integrating machine learning techniques, network analysis algorithms, and natural language processing tools. This method aims for generalizability across multiple platforms and types of user engagement. Two novel metrics, homogeneity and relevancy are introduced for the rigorous evaluation of identified frame candidates. Grounded in several foundational presumptions, including the role of topics and multi-word expressions in framing, the study sheds light on how frames emerge and gain significance within digital communities. The research questions explored include the methods for identifying frames, the variability and significance of these frames, and the effectiveness of different computational techniques in this context. To validate the approach, we present a case study of the 2021 Chilean presidential election, using data from both Twitter and WhatsApp platforms. This real-world application allows for the examination of how frames fluctuate in response to events and the specific mechanisms of platforms. Overall, the study makes several key contributions to the field, offering new insights and methodologies for analyzing the complexities of online polarization. It serves as groundwork for future research on the dynamics of online communities, especially those associated with distinctly polarized events.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Sarmiento, Hernan, Córdova, Ricardo, Ortiz, Jorge, Bravo-Marquez, Felipe, Santos, Marcelo, Valenzuela, Sebastián</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> ACM Trans.

Academic attention has recently shifted to emphasize the role of political elites as drivers of misinformation. Yet, little is known of the relationship between party politics and the spread of misinformation—in part due to a dearth of cross-national empirical data needed for comparative study. This article examines which parties are more likely to spread misinformation, by drawing on a comprehensive database of 32M tweets from parliamentarians in 26 countries, spanning 6 years and several election periods. The dataset is combined with external databases such as Parlgov and V-Dem, linking the spread of misinformation to detailed information about political parties and cabinets, thus enabling a comparative politics approach to misinformation. Using multilevel analysis with random country intercepts, we find that radical-right populism is the strongest determinant for the propensity to spread misinformation. Populism, left-wing populism, and right-wing politics are not linked to the spread of misinformation. These results suggest that political misinformation should be understood as part and parcel of the current wave of radical right populism, and its opposition to liberal democratic institution.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Törnberg, Petter, Chueri, Juliana</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> Int.

We close the gap on comparative studies of news values in misinformation with a perspective that emphasizes non-WEIRD countries. Relying on a dataset of URLs that were shared on Facebook in twenty-four countries and reported by users as containing false news, we compile a large corpus of online news items and use an array of computational tools to analyze its content with respect to a set of five news values (conflict, negativity, proximity, individualization, and informativeness). We find salient differences for almost all news values and regarding the WEIRD/non-WEIRD and flagged/unflagged distinction. Moreover, the prevalence of individual news values differs strongly for individual countries. However, while almost all differences are significant, the effects we encounter are mostly small.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Nenno, Sami, Puschmann, Cornelius</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> Int.

Informed by social psychological frameworks explicating message-level factors influencing public engagement and sentiment, the present study examines emotionality in 49,270 fact-checking posts created by 10 United States fact-checking organizations on Facebook from 2017 to 2022. Results showed that emotionality in fact-checking posts significantly increased by 13.5\\% over the years. Editorial fact-checkers (e.g., Washington Post) used higher levels of emotionality than independent fact-checkers (e.g., snopes.com). Emotionality positively indicated public engagement as predicted. However, in both fact-checked true and false information, emotionality was negatively associated with the public’s sentiment toward fact-checked targets, suggesting a potential spillover effect on stories verified to be true.

Several significant changes are observed, including a drop in participation from accounts that were not deplatformed and a de-centralization of the Twitter network. Conspiracy theories remain in the discourse, but their themes become more diffuse, and their calls to action more abstract. Recruiting calls to join in on promoting and publicizing the audit mostly come to an end. The decision by Twitter to deplatform key election audit accounts appears to have greatly disrupted the hub structure at the center of the emergent network that formed as a response to the election audit. By intervening in the network, moderators successfully defused much of the Twitter-based participation in the Arizona Election Review of 2021. This instance demonstrates the efficacy of network-driven interventions in platform moderation, specifically for events or accounts that use social media to organize or encourage bad-faith attacks on civic instituions.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Simeone, Michael, Corman, Steven R</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> SAGE Open</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2025</li><li><strong>Volume:</strong> 15</li><li><strong>Pages:</strong> 21582440251314538</li></ul>",

Open-ended responses allow for greater depth and variability in responses but are labor-intensive to code. Large Language Models (LLMs) can solve some of these problems, but existing approaches to using LLMs have a number of limitations. In this paper, we propose and test a pairwise comparison method to scale open-ended survey responses on a continuous scale. The approach relies on LLMs to make pairwise comparisons of statements that identify which statement ``wins&#x27;&#x27; and ``loses&#x27;&#x27;. With this information, we employ a Bayesian Bradley-Terry model to recover a `score&#x27; on a the relevant latent dimension for each statement. This approach allows for finer discrimination between items, better measures of uncertainty, reduces anchoring bias, and is more flexible than methods relying on Maximum Likelihood Estimation techniques. We demonstrate the utility of this approach on an open-ended question probing knowledge of interest rates in the US economy. A comparison of 6 LLMs of various sizes reveals that pairwise comparisons show greater consistency than zero-shot 0-10 ratings with larger models (&gt; 9-billion parameters). Further, comparison of pairwise decisions are consistent with high-knowledge crowd source workers.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> DiGiuseppe, Matthew, Flynn, Michael E</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> SocArXiv</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2025</li></ul>",

A common approach is to assess the trustworthiness of sources rather than individual pieces of content. One of the most widely used and comprehensive databases for source trustworthiness ratings is provided by NewsGuard. Since creating the database in 2019, NewsGuard has continually added new sources and reassessed existing ones. While NewsGuard initially focused only on the US, the database has expanded to include sources from other countries. In addition to trustworthiness ratings, the NewsGuard database contains various contextual assessments of the sources, which are less often used in contemporary research on misinformation. In this work, we provide an analysis of the content of the NewsGuard database, focusing on the temporal stability and completeness of its ratings across countries, as well as the usefulness of information on political orientation and topics for misinformation studies. We find that trustworthiness ratings and source coverage have remained relatively stable since 2022, particularly for the US, France, Italy, Germany, and Canada, with US-based sources consistently scoring lower than those from other countries. Additional information on the political orientation and topics covered by sources is comprehensive and provides valuable assets for characterizing sources beyond trustworthiness. By evaluating the database over time and across countries, we identify potential pitfalls that compromise the validity of using NewsGuard as a tool for quantifying untrustworthy information, particularly if dichotomous ``trustworthy&#x27;&#x27;/``untrustworthy&#x27;&#x27; labels are used. Lastly, we provide recommendations for digital media research on how to avoid these pitfalls and discuss appropriate use cases for the NewsGuard database and source-level approaches in general.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Lühring, Jula, Metzler, Hannah, Lazzaroni, Ruggero, Shetty, Apeksha, Lasser, Jana</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> J.

However, their open nature also makes them vulnerable to exploitation by malicious actors, including state-sponsored entities, who can conduct information operations (IOs) to manipulate public opinion. The spread of misinformation, false news, and misleading claims threatens democratic processes and societal cohesion, making it crucial to develop methods for the timely detection of inauthentic activity to protect the integrity of online discourse. In this work, we introduce a methodology designed to identify users orchestrating information operations, a.k.a. IO drivers, across various influence campaigns. Our framework, named IOHunter, leverages the combined strengths of Language Models and Graph Neural Networks to improve generalization in supervised, scarcely-supervised, and cross-IO contexts. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple sets of IOs originating from six countries, significantly surpassing existing approaches. This research marks a step toward developing Graph Foundation Models specifically tailored for the task of IO detection on social media platforms.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Minici, Marco, Luceri, Luca, Fabbri, Francesco, Ferrara, Emilio</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> arXiv [cs.SI]</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2024</li></ul>",

Yet most research studies a single platform—typically Twitter/X, or occasionally Facebook—leaving little known about the broader social media landscape. Here we shed new light on patterns of cross-platform variation in the high-stakes context of news sharing. We examine the relationship between user engagement and news domains’ political orientation and quality across seven platforms: Twitter/X, BlueSky, TruthSocial, Gab, GETTR, Mastodon, and LinkedIn. Using an exhaustive sampling strategy, we analyze all (over 10 million) posts containing links to news domains shared on these platforms during January 2024. We find that the news shared on platforms with more conservative user bases is significantly lower quality on average. Turning to patterns of engagement, we find—contrary to hypotheses of a consistent “right wing advantage” on social media—that the relationship between political lean and engagement is strongly heterogeneous across platforms. Conservative new posts receive more engagement on platforms where most content is conservative, and vice versa for liberal news posts, consistent with an “echo platform” perspective. In contrast, the relationship between news quality and engagement is strikingly consistent: across all platforms examined, lower-quality news posts received higher average engagement even though higher quality news is substantially more prevalent and garners far more total engagement across posts. This pattern holds despite accounting for poster-level variation, and is observed even in the absence of ranking algorithms, suggesting user preferences – not algorithmic – bias may underlie the underperformance of higher-quality news.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Mosleh, Mohsen, Allen, Jennifer Nancy Lee, Rand, David Gertler</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> PsyArXiv</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2024</li></ul>",

This study focuses on one prominent data collection approach, web scraping, and more specifically, its application in the growing field of research relying on web browsing data. We investigate discrepancies between content obtained directly during user interaction with a website (in-situ) and content scraped using the URLs of participants&#x27; logged visits (ex-situ) with various time delays (0, 30, 60, and 90 days). We find substantial disparities between the methodologies, uncovering that errors are not uniformly distributed across news categories regardless of classification method (domain, URL, or content analysis). These biases compromise the precision of measurements used in existing literature. The ex-situ collection environment is the primary source of the discrepancies (~33.8\\%), while the time delays in the scraping process play a smaller role (adding ~6.5 percentage points in 90 days). Our research emphasizes the need for data collection methods that capture web content directly in the user&#x27;s environment. However, acknowledging its complexities, we further explore strategies to mitigate biases in web-scraped browsing histories, offering recommendations for researchers who rely on this method and laying the groundwork for developing error-correction frameworks.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Ulloa, Roberto, Mangold, Frank, Schmidt, Felix, Gilsbach, Judith, Stier, Sebastian</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> arXiv [cs.CY]</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2024</li></ul>",

Influential hypotheses propose that they fulfill important psychological needs, thus resisting counterevidence. Yet previous failures in correcting conspiracy beliefs may be due to counterevidence being insufficiently compelling and tailored. To evaluate this possibility, we leveraged developments in generative artificial intelligence and engaged 2190 conspiracy believers in personalized evidence-based dialogues with GPT-4 Turbo. The intervention reduced conspiracy belief by ~20\\%. The effect remained 2 months later, generalized across a wide range of conspiracy theories, and occurred even among participants with deeply entrenched beliefs. Although the dialogues focused on a single conspiracy, they nonetheless diminished belief in unrelated conspiracies and shifted conspiracy-related behavioral intentions. These findings suggest that many conspiracy theory believers can revise their views if presented with sufficiently compelling evidence.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Costello, Thomas H, Pennycook, Gordon, Rand, David G</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> Science</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2024</li><li><strong>Volume:</strong> 385</li><li><strong>Pages:</strong> eadq1814</li></ul>",

Beyond the traditional methods of spreading misleading information through images and text, the medium of sound has emerged as a novel, platform-specific audiovisual technique. Our analysis distinguishes various war-related sounds utilized by both Ukraine and Russia and classifies them into a mis- and disinformation typology. We use computational propaganda features—automation, scalability, and anonymity—to explore how TikTok’s auditory practices are exploited to exacerbate information disorders in the context of ongoing war events. These practices include reusing sounds for coordinated campaigns, creating audio meme templates for rapid amplification and distribution, and deleting the original sounds to conceal the orchestrators’ identities. We conclude that TikTok’s recommendation system (the “for you” page) acts as a sound space where exposure is strategically navigated through users’ intervention, enabling semi-automated “soft” propaganda to thrive by leveraging its audio features.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Bösch, Marcus, Divon, Tom</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> New Media Soc.</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2024</li><li><strong>Volume:</strong> 26</li><li><strong>Pages:</strong> 5081--5106</li></ul>",

Public intellectuals and journalists frequently make sweeping claims about the effects of exposure to false content online that are inconsistent with much of the current empirical evidence. Here we identify three common misperceptions: that average exposure to problematic content is high, that algorithms are largely responsible for this exposure and that social media is a primary cause of broader social problems such as polarization. In our review of behavioural science research on online misinformation, we document a pattern of low exposure to false and inflammatory content that is concentrated among a narrow fringe with strong motivations to seek out such information. In response, we recommend holding platforms accountable for facilitating exposure to false and extreme content in the tails of the distribution, where consumption is highest and the risk of real-world harm is greatest. We also call for increased platform transparency, including collaborations with outside researchers, to better evaluate the effects of online misinformation and the most effective responses to it. Taking these steps is especially important outside the USA and Western Europe, where research and data are scant and harms may be more severe.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Budak, Ceren, Nyhan, Brendan, Rothschild, David M, Thorson, Emily, Watts, Duncan J</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> Nature</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2024</li><li><strong>Volume:</strong> 630</li><li><strong>Pages:</strong> 45--53</li></ul>",

We build on this work to estimate the ideology of a political YouTube video. First, we start with a matrix of political Reddit posts linking to YouTube videos and apply correspondence analysis to place those videos in an ideological space. Second, we train a language model with those estimated ideologies as training labels, enabling us to estimate the ideologies of videos not posted on Reddit. These predicted ideologies are then validated against human labels. We demonstrate the utility of this method by applying it to the watch histories of survey respondents to evaluate the prevalence of echo chambers on YouTube in addition to the association between video ideology and viewer engagement. Our approach gives video-level scores based only on supplied text metadata, is scalable, and can be easily adjusted to account for changes in the ideological landscape.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Lai, Angela, Brown, Megan A, Bisbee, James, Tucker, Joshua A, Nagler, Jonathan, Bonneau, Richard</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> Polit.
