These calls have included demands from affected parties to be given a seat at the table of AI evaluation. What, if anything, can public involvement add to the science of AI? In this perspective, we summarize the sociotechnical challenge of evaluating AI systems, which often adapt to multiple layers of social context that shape their outcomes. We then offer guidance for improving the science of AI by engaging lived-experience experts in the design, data collection, and interpretation of scientific evaluations. This article reviews common models of public engagement in AI research alongside common concerns about participatory methods, including questions about generalizable knowledge, subjectivity, reliability, and practical logistics. To address these questions, we summarize the literature on participatory science, discuss case studies from AI in healthcare, and share our own experience evaluating AI in areas from policing systems to social media algorithms. Overall, we describe five parts of any quantitative evaluation where public participation can improve the science of AI: equipoise, explanation, measurement, inference, and interpretation. We conclude with reflections on the role that participatory science can play in trustworthy AI by supporting trustworthy science.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Matias, J Nathan, Price, Megan</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> Proc.

We inform these concerns using pre-registered experiments to assess the ability of large language models to influence voter attitudes. In the context of the 2024 US presidential election, the 2025 Canadian federal election and the 2025 Polish presidential election, we assigned participants randomly to have a conversation with an AI model that advocated for one of the top two candidates. We observed significant treatment effects on candidate preference that are larger than typically observed from traditional video advertisements7–9. We also document large persuasion effects on Massachusetts residents’ support for a ballot measure legalizing psychedelics. Examining the persuasion strategies9 used by the models indicates that they persuade with relevant facts and evidence, rather than using sophisticated psychological persuasion techniques. Not all facts and evidence presented, however, were accurate; across all three countries, the AI models advocating for candidates on the political right made more inaccurate claims. Together, these findings highlight the potential for AI to influence voters and the important role it might play in future elections. Human–artificial intelligence (AI) dialogues can meaningfully impact voters’ attitudes towards presidential candidates and policy, demonstrating the potential of conversational AI to influence political decision-making.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Lin, Hause, Czarnek, Gabriela, Lewis, Benjamin, White, Joshua P, Berinsky, Adam J, Costello, Thomas, Pennycook, Gordon, Rand, David G</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> Nature</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2025</li><li><strong>Pages:</strong> 1--8</li></ul>",

In this paper, we expand upon this body of work using data collected from user feeds after Twitter&#x27;s change of ownership but before its re-branding to X. We replicate findings from prior work regarding the increased exposure of right-leaning accounts to wider audiences in algorithmically curated compared to reverse-chronological feeds, and, crucially, we further unpack this effect to understand what correlated (and did not correlate) with these differences. Our results reveal that right-leaning accounts benefited not necessarily due to their political affiliation, but possibly because they behaved in ways associated with algorithmic rewards; namely, posting more agitating content and receiving attention from the platform&#x27;s owner, Elon Musk, who was the most central network account. We also demonstrate that legacy-verified accounts, like businesses and government officials, received less exposure in the algorithmic feed compared to non-verified or Twitter Blue-verified accounts. We discuss implications of these findings for the intersection between behavioral incentives for algorithmic reach and online trust and safety.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Efstratiou, Alexandros, Duskin, Kayla, Starbird, Kate, Spiro, Emma</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> arXiv [cs.SI]</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2025</li></ul>",

This study investigates the interplay between manipulative social media actors, coordinated behaviors, and misleading information by analyzing coordinated link sharing behavior (CLSB) on Facebook in the United Kingdom and the United States. Drawing on a dataset of 3,469,719 public Facebook posts, we examine whether anti-vaccine content was disseminated more systematically and inauthentically than pro-vaccine content. We also trace the evolution of coordinated narratives over time and their cross-national variations. Methodologically, we apply computational techniques, including transfer learning for sentiment classification and structural topic modeling, to detect pro- and anti-vaccine stances and to identify thematic patterns within coordinated networks. Our findings reveal that in the UK, anti-vaccine entities exhibited denser CLSB networks and greater engagement than their pro-vaccine counterparts, whereas the opposite trend was observed in the U.S. Furthermore, we identify key differences in vaccine discourse: UK anti-vaccine communities predominantly emphasized vaccine safety concerns, while U.S. communities focused more on individual freedom. These cross-national comparisons highlight how political and cultural contexts shape the structure and rhetoric of vaccine-related coordination online.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Song, Yunya, Zhang, Yin, Zou, Sheng, Yang, Xian, Huang, Qintao</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> J.

Although Grokipedia articles are much longer than their corresponding English Wikipedia articles, we find that much of Grokipedia&#x27;s content (including both articles with and without Creative Commons licenses) is highly derivative of Wikipedia. Nevertheless, citation practices between the sites differ greatly, with Grokipedia citing many more sources deemed ``generally unreliable&#x27;&#x27; or ``blacklisted&#x27;&#x27; by the English Wikipedia community and low quality by external scholars, including dozens of citations to sites like Stormfront and Infowars. We then analyze article subsets: one about elected officials, one about controversial topics, and one random subset for which we derive article quality and topic. We find that the elected official and controversial article subsets showed less similarity between their Wikipedia version and Grokipedia version than other pages. The random subset illustrates that Grokipedia focused rewriting the highest quality articles on Wikipedia, with a bias towards biographies, politics, society, and history. Finally, we publicly release our nearly-full scrape of Grokipedia, as well as embeddings of the entire Grokipedia corpus.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Triedman, Harold, Mantzarlis, Alexios</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> arXiv [cs.SI]</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2025</li></ul>",

This debate highlights the challenges inherent in assessing the impacts of misinformation, as the drivers of false and misleading content often exist in the context of a specific claim. To address this issue, we examined false and misleading information surrounding the 2020 and 2022 U.S. national elections, focusing on the contextual features of online conversations that fueled various rumors. We developed two qualitative codebooks, creating the second after realizing that the first, which labeled individual tweets, failed to capture broader rumoring dynamics. By integrating multi-layered qualitative coding with thematic analysis and quantitative visualizations, we show how influencers, political elites, and audiences collaboratively told deep stories from 2020 through 2022. As these stories were told, audiences interpreted events in 2022 through the lens of the 2020 story, guided by influencers&#x27; cues, leading to an evolution in storytelling style between the two election cycles. This ongoing performance was tailored to align with the incentive structures, affordances, and attention economy of social media. We combine deep stories with theories of collective sensemaking and rumoring, creating a framework to better assess the contextual features surrounding false and misleading information.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Prochaska, Stephen, Vera, Julie, Lew Tan, Douglas, Yamron, Ben, Venuto, Sylvie, Kejriwal, Amaya, Chu, Sarah, Starbird, Kate</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> Proc.

While traditional IOs have been orchestrated by human operators and relied on manually crafted tactics, agentic AI promises to make campaigns more automated, adaptive, and difficult to detect. This work presents the first systematic study of emergent coordination among generative agents in simulated IO campaigns. Using generative agent-based modeling, we instantiate IO and organic agents in a simulated environment and evaluate coordination across operational regimes, from simple goal alignment to team knowledge and collective decision-making. As operational regimes become more structured, IO networks become denser and more clustered, interactions more reciprocal and positive, narratives more homogeneous, amplification more synchronized, and hashtag adoption faster and more sustained. Remarkably, simply revealing to agents which other agents share their goals can produce coordination levels nearly equivalent to those achieved through explicit deliberation and collective voting. Overall, we show that generative agents, even without human guidance, can reproduce coordination strategies characteristic of real-world IOs, underscoring the societal risks posed by increasingly automated, self-organizing IOs.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Orlando, Gian Marco, Ye, Jinyi, La Gatta, Valerio, Saeedi, Mahdi, Moscato, Vincenzo, Ferrara, Emilio, Luceri, Luca</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> arXiv [cs.MA]</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2025</li></ul>",

While we cannot know exactly what will be lost now that Twitter data is cost-prohibitive, we can illustrate its research value during the years it was available. A search of eight databases found that between 2006 and 2024, a total of 33,306 studies were published in 8,914 venues, with 610,738 citations across 16 disciplines. Major disciplines include social science, engineering, data science, and public health. Major topics include information dissemination, tweet credibility, research methodologies, event detection, and human behavior. Twitter-based studies increased by a median of 25\\% annually from 2006 to 2023, but following Twitter&#x27;s decision to charge for data, the number of studies dropped by 13\\%. Much of the 2024 research likely used data collected before the API shutdown, suggesting further decline ahead.

The concept of “misinformation” refers to false or inaccurate information. Misinformation-at scale occurs when false information is amplified online and shared by politicians, journalists, public figures, or other densely networked actors, whose engagement turns false claims into public controversies. This situation creates a paradox for social media companies and their users. On the one hand, the business model of social media companies is to increase engagement without consideration of the veracity of the content. As a result, content moderation methods have focused on reducing the speed and scale of misinformation, but not rooting it out entirely. On the other hand, users increasingly depend on social media companies for access to TALK (timely, accurate, local knowledge), which is difficult to discover, especially during breaking news or on contested subjects. This paper documents this history and discusses ways to address this challenge posed by misinformation-at-scale.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Donovan, Joan</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> J.

However, the methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) currently used in the field are unable to fully capture the connotative meaning of images, and struggle to produce easily interpretable clusters. In response to these challenges, we test an approach that leverages the ability of Vision-and-Large-Language-Models (VLLMs) to generate image descriptions that incorporate connotative interpretations of the input images. In particular, we use a VLLM to generate connotative textual descriptions of a set of images related to climate debate, and cluster the images based on these textual descriptions. In parallel, we cluster the same images using a more traditional approach based on CNNs. In doing so, we compare the connotative semantic validity of clusters generated using VLLMs with those produced using CNNs, and assess their interpretability. The results show that the approach based on VLLMs greatly improves the quality score for connotative clustering. Moreover, VLLM-based approaches, leveraging textual information as a step towards clustering, offer a high level of interpretability of the results.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Arminio, Luigi, Magnani, Matteo, Piqueras, Matías, Rossi, Luca, Segerberg, Alexandra</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> Soc.

Hyperactive social media users, who are over-proportionally active in relation to the mean, are the new political activists, spreading partisan content at scale on social media platforms. Using The Authenticity Matrix tool, this study revealed Facebook accounts of hyperactive users exhibiting inauthentic behaviour that were used during the electoral campaign (May 10, 2024, to June 8, 2024) for the 2024 election of Romanian members of the European Parliament. The results indicate that, for some posts, up to 45\\% of shares were made by hyperactive users (four or more shares per post by the same account) and 33.9\\% by super-active users (10 or more times). This type of online behavior is considered by Meta as manipulation of “public opinion,” “political discussion,” and “public debate,” and Meta’s Community Standards is committed to preventing such behavior in the context of elections. Another key contribution of this research is the identification of dominant characteristics of hyperactive user accounts, using information publicly available on their social media profile, which provides insights into their specific features and helps users better identify them on social media. The article highlights that online social network platforms condemn these manipulative practices in theory, but they don’t take sufficient measures to effectively reduce them in order to limit their impact on our societies.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Oprea, Bogdan, Pașnicu, Paula, Niculae, Alexandru-Ninel, Bonciu, Constantin-Cozmin, Tudorașcu-Dobre, Dragoș</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> Media Commun.</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2025</li><li><strong>Volume:</strong> 13</li></ul>",

Drawing on qualitative content analysis of 202 highly viewed videos, we examine how identity markers such as race and gender shape who is empowered or undermined in conspiratorial narratives, and how creators construct and circulate “evidence” to support their claims. We find that American ConspiracyTok is populated largely by young, non-White, and/or female creators who challenge the stereotype of the White, male conspiracy theorist. These creators interpellate audiences through visible identity markers, fostering a sense of intimacy and trust. Marginalized groups are often cast as victims, while institutions like science, government, and media are portrayed as villains. Creators construct legitimacy through visual media, personal anecdotes, deep lore, and remixing fictional and mainstream texts—engaging in a form of populist knowledge production within a generous epistemology that welcomes divergent truths and alternative worldviews. These practices blur the lines between entertainment and ideology, often mimicking academic, or journalistic knowledge production while rejecting institutional authority. While ConspiracyTok can serve as a form of standpoint epistemology that empowers minoritized creators and critiques systemic injustice, it can just as easily reinforce bias and spread disinformation. ConspiracyTok is a site of vernacular theorizing where epistemology and identity are deeply entangled, offering both a critique of mainstream power and a cautionary tale about the populist appeal of conspiratorial thinking.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Marwick, Alice, Pippert, Courtlyn, Furl, Katherine, Schnabel, Elaine</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> Soc.

However, deploying these models requires overcoming significant technical and resource barriers. We demonstrate how to adapt open-source language models to specialized political science tasks, using conflict event classification as our proof of concept. Through quantization and efficient fine-tuning techniques, we show state-of-the-art performance while minimizing computational requirements. Our approach achieves a macro-averaged AUC of 0.791 and a weighted F1-score of 0.753, representing a 37.6\\% improvement over the base model, with accuracy gains of up to 1463\\% in challenging classifications. We offer a roadmap for political scientists to adapt these methods to their own research domains, democratizing access to advanced NLP capabilities across the discipline.

This study compares different ways of operationalizing the detection of multimodal coordinated behavior. It examines the trade-off between weakly and strongly integrated multimodal models, highlighting the balance between capturing broader coordination patterns and identifying tightly coordinated behavior. By comparing monomodal and multimodal approaches, we assess the unique contributions of different data modalities and explore how varying implementations of multimodality impact detection outcomes. Our findings reveal that not all the modalities provide distinct insights, but that with a multimodal approach we can get a more comprehensive understanding of coordination dynamics.

Theorized more carefully, thinking in terms of narrative has much to offer disinformation studies by helping to better define what constitutes disinformation and providing sophisticated frameworks for assessing specific content. To enable a nuanced view of narrative truth, I propose a “hermeneutic realist” approach in which stories “disclose” wider realities rather than constructing or simply reflecting them, supplemented with Phelan’s “narrative ethics” to facilitate inquiry into how far stories are morally legitimate. I apply these ideas in a case study of Twitter content posted by a Venezuelan political influencer blaming Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine on NATO enlargement. In so doing, I show that content may be referentially and ethically problematic without necessarily being false.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Sadler, Neil</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> Commun.

Through systematic weekly searches over six months using eleven queries, we identify major limitations regarding completeness, representativeness, consistency, and bias. Our findings reveal substantial differences between ranking parameters like relevance and date in terms of video recall and precision, with relevance often retrieving numerous off-topic videos. We also find severe temporal decay, as the number of findable videos for a specific period dramatically decreases after just 20-60 days from the publication date, potentially hampering many different research designs. Furthermore, search results lack consistency, with identical queries yielding different video sets over time, compromising replicability. A case study on the European Parliament elections highlights how these issues impact research outcomes. While the paper offers several mitigation strategies, it concludes that the API&#x27;s search function, potentially prioritizing ``freshness&#x27;&#x27; over comprehensive retrieval, is not adequate for robust academic research, especially concerning Digital Services Act requirements.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Rieder, Bernhard, Padilla, Adrian, Coromina, Oscar</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> arXiv [cs.IR]</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2025</li></ul>",

This is a key measurement problem in sociological inquiry, from the study of how interest groups shape media discourse, to the spread of policy across institutions, to the diffusion of organizational structures and institution themselves. To study how ideas and narratives diffuse across text, we must first develop a method to identify whether texts share the same information and narratives, rather than the same broad themes or exact features. We propose a novel approach to measure this quantity of interest, which we call “narrative similarity,” by using large language models to distill texts to their core ideas and then compare the similarity of claims rather than of words, phrases, or sentences. The result is an estimand much closer to narrative similarity than what is possible with past relevant alternatives, including exact text reuse, which returns lexically similar documents; topic modeling, which returns topically similar documents; or an array of alternative approaches. We devise an approach to providing out-of-sample measures of performance (precision, recall, F1) and show that our approach outperforms relevant alternatives by a large margin. We apply our approach to an important case study: The spread of Russian claims about the development of a Ukrainian bioweapons program in U.S. mainstream and fringe news websites. While we focus on news in this application, our approach can be applied more broadly to the study of propaganda, misinformation, diffusion of policy and cultural objects, among other topics.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Waight, Hannah, Messing, Solomon, Shirikov, Anton, Roberts, Margaret E, Nagler, Jonathan, Greenfield, Jason, Brown, Megan A, Aslett, Kevin, Tucker, Joshua A</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> Sociol.

However, their ability to do this within political discourse remains largely underexplored. Leveraging, for the first time, the large IMPAQTS corpus, which comprises Italian political speeches with the annotation of manipulative implicit content, we propose methods to test the effectiveness of LLMs in this challenging problem. Through a multiple-choice task and an open-ended generation task, we demonstrate that all tested models struggle to interpret presuppositions and implicatures. We conclude that current LLMs lack the key pragmatic capabilities necessary for accurately interpreting highly implicit language, such as that found in political discourse.

Despite acknowledging the presence of coordinated campaigns and implementing restrictions on the number of messages forwarded per user, the platform continues to be abused. Due to its private nature and the difficulty of collecting information, little is known about these campaigns and the messages they disseminate. Given this context, our study investigates the presence of coordinated activities on WhatsApp in Brazil, identifying their content and purpose, especially how these messages relate to recent Brazilian political events. To answer these questions, we analyzed 13 million messages from 1,444 political groups over seven months from July 2022 to January 2023. Using network analysis, our findings suggest a significant prevalence of coordinated activity in the propagation of news messages, 26\\% of which originate from misinformation sites. Furthermore, we found that images play a key role in coordinated activity, accounting for 15\\% of messages, which are also used to mislead. Finally, coordinated accounts were used to organize collective actions, including attacks and protests against election results.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Kansaon, Daniel, Melo, Philipe de Freitas, Zannettou, Savvas, Benevenuto, Fabricio</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2025</li><li><strong>Volume:</strong> 19</li><li><strong>Pages:</strong> 1007--1020</li></ul>",

By framing their beliefs as the rational and logical results of fully considering a plethora of evidence, redpill adherents can justify holding and promoting otherwise indefensible prejudices.

Our experiment reveals that the API fails to provide metadata for one in eight videos provided through data donations, including official TikTok videos, advertisements, and content from specific accounts, without an apparent reason. The API data is incomplete, making it unreliable when working with data donations, a prominent methodology for algorithm audits and research on platform accountability. To monitor the functionality of the API and eventual fixes implemented by TikTok, we publish a dashboard with a daily check of the availability of 10 videos that were not retrievable in the last month. The video list includes very well-known accounts, notably that of Taylor Swift. The current API lacks the necessary capabilities for thorough independent research and scrutiny.

To address this gap, we develop and evaluate a computational framework for detecting CIB on TikTok, leveraging a network-based approach adapted to the platform&#x27;s unique content and interaction structures. Building on existing approaches, we construct user similarity networks based on shared behaviors, including synchronized posting, repeated use of similar captions, multimedia content reuse, and hashtag sequence overlap, and apply graph pruning techniques to identify dense networks of likely coordinated accounts. Analyzing a dataset of 793K TikTok videos related to the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, we uncover a range of coordinated activities, from synchronized amplification of political narratives to semi-automated content replication using AI-generated voiceovers and split-screen video formats. Our findings show that while traditional coordination indicators generalize well to TikTok, other signals, such as those based on textual similarity of video transcripts or Duet and Stitch interactions, prove ineffective, highlighting the platform&#x27;s distinct content norms and interaction mechanics. This work provides the first empirical foundation for studying and detecting CIB on TikTok, paving the way for future research into influence operations in short-form video platforms.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Luceri, Luca, Salkar, Tanishq Vijay, Balasubramanian, Ashwin, Pinto, Gabriela, Sun, Chenning, Ferrara, Emilio</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> arXiv [cs.SI]</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2025</li></ul>",

The review of 129 studies identifies variations in measurement approaches, as well as regional, political, cultural, and platform-specific biases, as key factors contributing to the lack of consensus. Studies based on homophily and computational social science methods often support the echo chamber hypothesis, while research on content exposure and broader media environments, such as surveys, tends to challenge it. Group behavior, cultural influences, instant messaging platforms, and short video platforms remain underexplored. The strong geographic focus on the United States further highlights the need for studies in multi-party systems and regions beyond the Global North. Future research should prioritize cross-platform studies, continuous algorithmic audits, and investigations into the causal links between polarization, fragmentation, and echo chambers to advance the field. This review also provides recommendations for using the EU’s Digital Services Act to enhance research in this area and conduct studies outside the US in multi-party systems. By addressing these gaps, this review contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of echo chambers, their measurement, and their societal impacts.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Hartmann, David, Wang, Sonja Mei, Pohlmann, Lena, Berendt, Bettina</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> J.

In this study, we quantify the efficacy of CIB tactics by defining a general framework for evaluating the influence of a subset of nodes in a directed tree. We design two algorithms that provide optimal and greedy post-hoc placement strategies that lead to maximising the configuration influence. We then consider cascades from information spreading on X (formerly known as Twitter) to compare the observed behaviour with our algorithms. The results show that, according to our model, coordinated accounts are quite inefficient in terms of their network influence, thus suggesting that they may play a less pivotal role than expected. Moreover, the causes of these poor results may be found in two separate aspects: a bad placement strategy and a scarcity of resources.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Di Marco, Niccolò, Brunetti, Sara, Cinelli, Matteo, Quattrociocchi, Walter</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> ACM Trans.

The article presents practice mapping as an analytical framework and outlines its key methodological considerations. Given its prominence in past social media research, we draw on examples and data from the platform formerly known as Twitter to enable experienced scholars to translate their approaches to a practice mapping paradigm more easily, but point out how data from other platforms may be used in equivalent ways in practice mapping studies.

This theoretical article draws on the concept of connective democracy, further theorizing it to bridge the gap between empirical online deliberation and polarization research. It introduces and refines the concept of destructive polarization and its symptoms—manifested in user-generated content on social media platforms—and applies connective democracy theory to examine these symptoms’ underlying causes. The framework shifts from the dominant focus on the quality of individual communication acts to a focus on the quality of connections, particularly within dyadic communication. Through this relational perspective, the article explores how reciprocity and listening can serve as remedies to destructive polarization, fostering high-quality connections between citizens online. Reciprocity and listening are discussed as communicative mechanisms that should be nurtured as part of depolarization strategies. Finally, the article offers insights into what platform providers and community managers can learn from this theoretical exercise to promote democratic discourse online.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Esau, Katharina</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> Soc.

Drawing from 22 in-depth interviews with IO leads and staff, we define IOs’ broker attributes, their brokerage processes, and the capital and value they generate through brokerage. We identify four mechanisms of brokerage by IOs: infrastructural capacity, reputation manipulation, relationship building at scale, and obscured accountability. These mechanisms complement the brokerage work by aboveboard campaigns and other brokers by compensating for their limitations and innovating campaign strategies. We argue that IOs are not extraneous deviations but are logical extensions of existing political infrastructures and should be understood as operating with other normative forms of political campaigning.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Gaw, Fatima, Agonos, Mariam Jayne, Ruijgrok, Kris, Suarez, Gerard Martin</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> Int.

Although insightful, the institutionalist literature offers little reflection about the growing role of social technologies in organizing and mobilizing extremist networks in ways that present many challenges to traditional party gatekeeping, institutional integrity, and other democratic principles. We present a more integrated framework that explains how digitally networked publics interact with more traditional party surrogates and electoral processes to bring once-scattered extremist factions into conservative parties. When increasingly reactionary parties gain power, they may push both institutions and communication processes in illiberal directions.

This bias could result in labels applied by LLMs that disproportionately align with majority groups over a more diverse set of viewpoints. In this paper, we evaluate how LLMs represent diverse viewpoints on these contentious tasks. Across four annotation tasks on four datasets, we show that LLMs do not show systematic substantial disagreement with annotators on the basis of demographics. Rather, we find that multiple LLMs tend to be biased in the same directions on the same demographic categories within the same datasets. Moreover, the disagreement between human annotators on the labeling task -- a measure of item difficulty -- is far more predictive of LLM agreement with human annotators. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for researchers and practitioners using LLMs for automated data annotation tasks. Specifically, we emphasize that fairness evaluations must be contextual, model choice alone will not solve potential issues of bias, and item difficulty must be integrated into bias assessments.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Brown, Megan A, Atreja, Shubham, Hemphill, Libby, Wu, Patrick Y</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> arXiv [cs.CL]</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2025</li></ul>",

How is Meta identifying ‘solutions’ to those problems? And is Meta ‘nudging’ policymakers in specific conceptual directions?

The study proposes a comprehensive methodology for identifying and characterizing these frames, integrating machine learning techniques, network analysis algorithms, and natural language processing tools. This method aims for generalizability across multiple platforms and types of user engagement. Two novel metrics, homogeneity and relevancy are introduced for the rigorous evaluation of identified frame candidates. Grounded in several foundational presumptions, including the role of topics and multi-word expressions in framing, the study sheds light on how frames emerge and gain significance within digital communities. The research questions explored include the methods for identifying frames, the variability and significance of these frames, and the effectiveness of different computational techniques in this context. To validate the approach, we present a case study of the 2021 Chilean presidential election, using data from both Twitter and WhatsApp platforms. This real-world application allows for the examination of how frames fluctuate in response to events and the specific mechanisms of platforms. Overall, the study makes several key contributions to the field, offering new insights and methodologies for analyzing the complexities of online polarization. It serves as groundwork for future research on the dynamics of online communities, especially those associated with distinctly polarized events.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Sarmiento, Hernan, Córdova, Ricardo, Ortiz, Jorge, Bravo-Marquez, Felipe, Santos, Marcelo, Valenzuela, Sebastián</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> ACM Trans.

Results showed that emotionality in fact-checking posts significantly increased by 13.5\\% over the years. Editorial fact-checkers (e.g., Washington Post) used higher levels of emotionality than independent fact-checkers (e.g., snopes.com). Emotionality positively indicated public engagement as predicted. However, in both fact-checked true and false information, emotionality was negatively associated with the public’s sentiment toward fact-checked targets, suggesting a potential spillover effect on stories verified to be true.

A common approach is to assess the trustworthiness of sources rather than individual pieces of content. One of the most widely used and comprehensive databases for source trustworthiness ratings is provided by NewsGuard. Since creating the database in 2019, NewsGuard has continually added new sources and reassessed existing ones. While NewsGuard initially focused only on the US, the database has expanded to include sources from other countries. In addition to trustworthiness ratings, the NewsGuard database contains various contextual assessments of the sources, which are less often used in contemporary research on misinformation. In this work, we provide an analysis of the content of the NewsGuard database, focusing on the temporal stability and completeness of its ratings across countries, as well as the usefulness of information on political orientation and topics for misinformation studies. We find that trustworthiness ratings and source coverage have remained relatively stable since 2022, particularly for the US, France, Italy, Germany, and Canada, with US-based sources consistently scoring lower than those from other countries. Additional information on the political orientation and topics covered by sources is comprehensive and provides valuable assets for characterizing sources beyond trustworthiness. By evaluating the database over time and across countries, we identify potential pitfalls that compromise the validity of using NewsGuard as a tool for quantifying untrustworthy information, particularly if dichotomous ``trustworthy&#x27;&#x27;/``untrustworthy&#x27;&#x27; labels are used. Lastly, we provide recommendations for digital media research on how to avoid these pitfalls and discuss appropriate use cases for the NewsGuard database and source-level approaches in general.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Lühring, Jula, Metzler, Hannah, Lazzaroni, Ruggero, Shetty, Apeksha, Lasser, Jana</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> J.

This study analyzes Twitter data from before and after the removal of key Arizona Election Audit Twitter accounts in March of 2021. After collecting tweets that refer to the election audit in Arizona in this designated timeframe, a before/after comparison examines the structure of the networks, the volume of the participating population, and the themes of their discourse. Several significant changes are observed, including a drop in participation from accounts that were not deplatformed and a de-centralization of the Twitter network. Conspiracy theories remain in the discourse, but their themes become more diffuse, and their calls to action more abstract. Recruiting calls to join in on promoting and publicizing the audit mostly come to an end. The decision by Twitter to deplatform key election audit accounts appears to have greatly disrupted the hub structure at the center of the emergent network that formed as a response to the election audit. By intervening in the network, moderators successfully defused much of the Twitter-based participation in the Arizona Election Review of 2021. This instance demonstrates the efficacy of network-driven interventions in platform moderation, specifically for events or accounts that use social media to organize or encourage bad-faith attacks on civic instituions.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Simeone, Michael, Corman, Steven R</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> SAGE Open</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2025</li><li><strong>Volume:</strong> 15</li><li><strong>Pages:</strong> 21582440251314538</li></ul>",

Large Language Models (LLMs) can solve some of these problems, but existing approaches to using LLMs have a number of limitations. In this paper, we propose and test a pairwise comparison method to scale open-ended survey responses on a continuous scale. The approach relies on LLMs to make pairwise comparisons of statements that identify which statement ``wins&#x27;&#x27; and ``loses&#x27;&#x27;. With this information, we employ a Bayesian Bradley-Terry model to recover a `score&#x27; on a the relevant latent dimension for each statement. This approach allows for finer discrimination between items, better measures of uncertainty, reduces anchoring bias, and is more flexible than methods relying on Maximum Likelihood Estimation techniques. We demonstrate the utility of this approach on an open-ended question probing knowledge of interest rates in the US economy. A comparison of 6 LLMs of various sizes reveals that pairwise comparisons show greater consistency than zero-shot 0-10 ratings with larger models (&gt; 9-billion parameters). Further, comparison of pairwise decisions are consistent with high-knowledge crowd source workers.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> DiGiuseppe, Matthew, Flynn, Michael E</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> SocArXiv</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2025</li></ul>",

Although such research has investigated the topical and stylistic characteristics of misinformation, its findings are frequently not interpreted systematically in relation to properties that journalists rely on to capture the attention of audiences, that is, in relation to news values. We close the gap on comparative studies of news values in misinformation with a perspective that emphasizes non-WEIRD countries. Relying on a dataset of URLs that were shared on Facebook in twenty-four countries and reported by users as containing false news, we compile a large corpus of online news items and use an array of computational tools to analyze its content with respect to a set of five news values (conflict, negativity, proximity, individualization, and informativeness). We find salient differences for almost all news values and regarding the WEIRD/non-WEIRD and flagged/unflagged distinction. Moreover, the prevalence of individual news values differs strongly for individual countries. However, while almost all differences are significant, the effects we encounter are mostly small.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Nenno, Sami, Puschmann, Cornelius</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> Int.

Academic attention has recently shifted to emphasize the role of political elites as drivers of misinformation. Yet, little is known of the relationship between party politics and the spread of misinformation—in part due to a dearth of cross-national empirical data needed for comparative study. This article examines which parties are more likely to spread misinformation, by drawing on a comprehensive database of 32M tweets from parliamentarians in 26 countries, spanning 6 years and several election periods. The dataset is combined with external databases such as Parlgov and V-Dem, linking the spread of misinformation to detailed information about political parties and cabinets, thus enabling a comparative politics approach to misinformation. Using multilevel analysis with random country intercepts, we find that radical-right populism is the strongest determinant for the propensity to spread misinformation. Populism, left-wing populism, and right-wing politics are not linked to the spread of misinformation. These results suggest that political misinformation should be understood as part and parcel of the current wave of radical right populism, and its opposition to liberal democratic institution.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Törnberg, Petter, Chueri, Juliana</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> Int.

Using time series analysis techniques including cross-correlation, Granger causality, and anomaly detection, we modeled this data to test for the relationship between significant algorithmic ranking updates to Facebook’s News Feed algorithms and user engagement with Guardian articles on the platform. Our results show that strategic interventions to the News Feed algorithm significantly impacted engagement with hard news items, whereas opinion, lifestyle, sports, and arts content were less affected. This study challenges the notion of algorithms as ‘black boxes’ by demonstrating how Facebook’s deliberate adjustments influence user engagement with news content. We conclude by outlining the limitations and challenges for systemic auditing of social media algorithms, advocating for greater data access, and discussing the opportunities afforded by the EU’s Digital Services Act to advance this research agenda.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> McNally, Naoise, Bastos, Marco</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> Digit.

      "content_html": "<h3>Abstract</h3><p>In recent years, social media has become increasingly fragmented, as platforms evolve and new alternatives emerge. Yet most research studies a single platform—typically Twitter/X, or occasionally Facebook—leaving little known about the broader social media landscape. Here we shed new light on patterns of cross-platform variation in the high-stakes context of news sharing. We examine the relationship between user engagement and news domains’ political orientation and quality across seven platforms: Twitter/X, BlueSky, TruthSocial, Gab, GETTR, Mastodon, and LinkedIn. Using an exhaustive sampling strategy, we analyze all (over 10 million) posts containing links to news domains shared on these platforms during January 2024. We find that the news shared on platforms with more conservative user bases is significantly lower quality on average. Turning to patterns of engagement, we find—contrary to hypotheses of a consistent “right wing advantage” on social media—that the relationship between political lean and engagement is strongly heterogeneous across platforms. Conservative new posts receive more engagement on platforms where most content is conservative, and vice versa for liberal news posts, consistent with an “echo platform” perspective. In contrast, the relationship between news quality and engagement is strikingly consistent: across all platforms examined, lower-quality news posts received higher average engagement even though higher quality news is substantially more prevalent and garners far more total engagement across posts. This pattern holds despite accounting for poster-level variation, and is observed even in the absence of ranking algorithms, suggesting user preferences – not algorithmic – bias may underlie the underperformance of higher-quality news.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Mosleh, Mohsen, Allen, Jennifer Nancy Lee, Rand, David Gertler</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> PsyArXiv</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2024</li></ul>",

We investigate discrepancies between content obtained directly during user interaction with a website (in-situ) and content scraped using the URLs of participants&#x27; logged visits (ex-situ) with various time delays (0, 30, 60, and 90 days). We find substantial disparities between the methodologies, uncovering that errors are not uniformly distributed across news categories regardless of classification method (domain, URL, or content analysis). These biases compromise the precision of measurements used in existing literature. The ex-situ collection environment is the primary source of the discrepancies (~33.8\\%), while the time delays in the scraping process play a smaller role (adding ~6.5 percentage points in 90 days). Our research emphasizes the need for data collection methods that capture web content directly in the user&#x27;s environment. However, acknowledging its complexities, we further explore strategies to mitigate biases in web-scraped browsing histories, offering recommendations for researchers who rely on this method and laying the groundwork for developing error-correction frameworks.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Ulloa, Roberto, Mangold, Frank, Schmidt, Felix, Gilsbach, Judith, Stier, Sebastian</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> arXiv [cs.CY]</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2024</li></ul>",

Beyond the traditional methods of spreading misleading information through images and text, the medium of sound has emerged as a novel, platform-specific audiovisual technique. Our analysis distinguishes various war-related sounds utilized by both Ukraine and Russia and classifies them into a mis- and disinformation typology. We use computational propaganda features—automation, scalability, and anonymity—to explore how TikTok’s auditory practices are exploited to exacerbate information disorders in the context of ongoing war events. These practices include reusing sounds for coordinated campaigns, creating audio meme templates for rapid amplification and distribution, and deleting the original sounds to conceal the orchestrators’ identities. We conclude that TikTok’s recommendation system (the “for you” page) acts as a sound space where exposure is strategically navigated through users’ intervention, enabling semi-automated “soft” propaganda to thrive by leveraging its audio features.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Bösch, Marcus, Divon, Tom</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> New Media Soc.</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2024</li><li><strong>Volume:</strong> 26</li><li><strong>Pages:</strong> 5081--5106</li></ul>",

Here we identify three common misperceptions: that average exposure to problematic content is high, that algorithms are largely responsible for this exposure and that social media is a primary cause of broader social problems such as polarization. In our review of behavioural science research on online misinformation, we document a pattern of low exposure to false and inflammatory content that is concentrated among a narrow fringe with strong motivations to seek out such information. In response, we recommend holding platforms accountable for facilitating exposure to false and extreme content in the tails of the distribution, where consumption is highest and the risk of real-world harm is greatest. We also call for increased platform transparency, including collaborations with outside researchers, to better evaluate the effects of online misinformation and the most effective responses to it. Taking these steps is especially important outside the USA and Western Europe, where research and data are scant and harms may be more severe.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Budak, Ceren, Nyhan, Brendan, Rothschild, David M, Thorson, Emily, Watts, Duncan J</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> Nature</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2024</li><li><strong>Volume:</strong> 630</li><li><strong>Pages:</strong> 45--53</li></ul>",

We build on this work to estimate the ideology of a political YouTube video.

Second, we train a language model with those estimated ideologies as training labels, enabling us to estimate the ideologies of videos not posted on Reddit. These predicted ideologies are then validated against human labels. We demonstrate the utility of this method by applying it to the watch histories of survey respondents to evaluate the prevalence of echo chambers on YouTube in addition to the association between video ideology and viewer engagement.

We directly measured ideological homophily in friend networks and examined the extent to which heterogeneous friends could potentially expose individuals to cross-cutting content. We then quantified the extent to which individuals encounter comparatively more or less diverse content while interacting via Facebook&#x27;s algorithmically ranked News Feed and further studied users&#x27; choices to click through to ideologically discordant content. Compared with algorithmic ranking, individuals&#x27; choices played a stronger role in limiting exposure to cross-cutting content.</p><h3>Details</h3><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> Bakshy, Eytan, Messing, Solomon, Adamic, Lada A</li><li><strong>Published in:</strong> Science</li><li><strong>Year:</strong> 2015</li><li><strong>Volume:</strong> 348</li><li><strong>Pages:</strong> 1130--1132</li></ul>",
