                   study focuses on one prominent data collection approach, web
                   scraping, and more specifically, its application in the
                   growing field of research relying on web browsing data. We
                   investigate discrepancies between content obtained directly
                   during user interaction with a website (in-situ) and content
                   scraped using the URLs of participants' logged visits
                   (ex-situ) with various time delays (0, 30, 60, and 90 days).
                   We find substantial disparities between the methodologies,
                   uncovering that errors are not uniformly distributed across
                   news categories regardless of classification method (domain,
                   URL, or content analysis). These biases compromise the
                   precision of measurements used in existing literature. The
                   ex-situ collection environment is the primary source of the
                   discrepancies (~33.8\%), while the time delays in the
                   scraping process play a smaller role (adding ~6.5 percentage
                   points in 90 days). Our research emphasizes the need for data
                   collection methods that capture web content directly in the
                   user's environment. However, acknowledging its complexities,

  abstract = "The controversy over online misinformation and social media has
              opened a gap between public discourse and scientific research.
              Public intellectuals and journalists frequently make sweeping
              claims about the effects of exposure to false content online that
              are inconsistent with much of the current empirical evidence. Here
              we identify three common misperceptions: that average exposure to
              problematic content is high, that algorithms are largely
              responsible for this exposure and that social media is a primary
              cause of broader social problems such as polarization. In our
              review of behavioural science research on online misinformation,
              we document a pattern of low exposure to false and inflammatory
              content that is concentrated among a narrow fringe with strong
              motivations to seek out such information. In response, we
              recommend holding platforms accountable for facilitating exposure
              to false and extreme content in the tails of the distribution,
              where consumption is highest and the risk of real-world harm is
              greatest. We also call for increased platform transparency,
              including collaborations with outside researchers, to better
              evaluate the effects of online misinformation and the most
              effective responses to it. Taking these steps is especially
              important outside the USA and Western Europe, where research and
              data are scant and harms may be more severe.",

              Academic attention has recently shifted to emphasize the role of
              political elites as drivers of misinformation. Yet, little is
              known of the relationship between party politics and the spread of

              comprehensive database of 32M tweets from parliamentarians in 26

              information about political parties and cabinets, thus enabling a

              and right-wing politics are not linked to the spread of

              structure of Twitter networks, the number of people involved, and

              fewer contributions from accounts that weren‚Äôt removed and a less

              necessarily limit the depth and variability of responses.
              Open-ended responses allow for greater depth and variability in
              responses but are labor-intensive to code. Large Language Models
              (LLMs) can solve some of these problems, but existing approaches
              to using LLMs have a number of limitations. In this paper, we
              propose and test a pairwise comparison method to scale open-ended
              survey responses on a continuous scale. The approach relies on
              LLMs to make pairwise comparisons of statements that identify
              which statement ``wins'' and ``loses''. With this information, we
              employ a Bayesian Bradley-Terry model to recover a `score' on a
              the relevant latent dimension for each statement. This approach
              allows for finer discrimination between items, better measures of
              uncertainty, reduces anchoring bias, and is more flexible than
              methods relying on Maximum Likelihood Estimation techniques. We
              demonstrate the utility of this approach on an open-ended question
              probing knowledge of interest rates in the US economy. A
              comparison of 6 LLMs of various sizes reveals that pairwise
              comparisons show greater consistency than zero-shot 0-10 ratings
              with larger models (> 9-billion parameters). Further, comparison
              of pairwise decisions are consistent with high-knowledge crowd
              source workers.",

  abstract = "Researchers need reliable and valid tools to identify cases of
              untrustworthy information when studying the spread of
              misinformation on digital platforms. A common approach is to
              assess the trustworthiness of sources rather than individual
              pieces of content. One of the most widely used and comprehensive
              databases for source trustworthiness ratings is provided by
              NewsGuard. Since creating the database in 2019, NewsGuard has
              continually added new sources and reassessed existing ones. While
              NewsGuard initially focused only on the US, the database has
              expanded to include sources from other countries. In addition to
              trustworthiness ratings, the NewsGuard database contains various
              contextual assessments of the sources, which are less often used
              in contemporary research on misinformation. In this work, we
              provide an analysis of the content of the NewsGuard database,
              focusing on the temporal stability and completeness of its ratings
              across countries, as well as the usefulness of information on
              political orientation and topics for misinformation studies. We
              find that trustworthiness ratings and source coverage have
              remained relatively stable since 2022, particularly for the US,
              France, Italy, Germany, and Canada, with US-based sources
              consistently scoring lower than those from other countries.
              Additional information on the political orientation and topics
              covered by sources is comprehensive and provides valuable assets
              for characterizing sources beyond trustworthiness. By evaluating
              the database over time and across countries, we identify potential
              pitfalls that compromise the validity of using NewsGuard as a tool
              for quantifying untrustworthy information, particularly if
              dichotomous ``trustworthy''/``untrustworthy'' labels are used.
              Lastly, we provide recommendations for digital media research on
              how to avoid these pitfalls and discuss appropriate use cases for
              the NewsGuard database and source-level approaches in general.",
